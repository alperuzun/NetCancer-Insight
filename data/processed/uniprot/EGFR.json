  "gene": "EGFR",
  "accession": "P00533",
  "protein_name": "Epidermal growth factor receptor",
  "function": "Receptor tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family and activating several signaling cascades to convert extracellular cues into appropriate cellular responses (PubMed:10805725, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:2790960, PubMed:35538033). Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, AREG, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF (PubMed:12297049, PubMed:15611079, PubMed:17909029, PubMed:20837704, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:2790960, PubMed:7679104, PubMed:8144591, PubMed:9419975). Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules (PubMed:27153536). May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade (PubMed:11116146). Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:11602604). Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin (PubMed:11483589). Positively regulates cell migration via interaction with CCDC88A/GIV which retains EGFR at the cell membrane following ligand stimulation, promoting EGFR signaling which triggers cell migration (PubMed:20462955). Plays a role in enhancing learning and memory performance (By similarity). Plays a role in mammalian pain signaling (long-lasting hypersensitivity) (By similarity). Isoform 2 may act as an antagonist of EGF action. (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes and facilitates its cell entry. Mediates HCV entry by promoting the formation of the CD81-CLDN1 receptor complexes that are essential for HCV entry and by enhancing membrane fusion of cells expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins. ",
  "disease": "Lung cancer: A common malignancy affecting tissues of the lung. The most common form of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be divided into 3 major histologic subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell lung cancer. NSCLC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis.. Neonatal nephrocutaneous inflammatory syndrome: An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, premature birth, fragile skin, recurrent skin infections and sepsis, failure to thrive, nephrocalcinosis, and nephromegaly with tubular dysfunction. Some patients have chronic diarrhea, and necrotizing enterocolitis.. "
