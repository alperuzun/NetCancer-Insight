An elevated level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol constitutes a major risk factor for genesis of atherosclerosis. LDL can accumulate within the blood vessel wall and undergo modification by oxidation. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) leads to endothelial dysfunction leading to expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of monocyte in subendothelial space. The monocytes proliferate, differentiate into macrophages, and take up the lipoproteins, forming cholesterol-engorged \"foam cells.\" With the time, the foam cells die, leaving a 'necrotic core' of crystalline cholesterol and cell debris. Smooth muscle cells proliferate and migrate into the region, laying down a protective cap over the lesion.
